# Zapper (VSC Extension)

This is a vscode (and similar editors) extension for the Zapper CLI.

Zapper is a CLI tool that allows you to run a project that can have multiple services. Some of them can be native, some of them can be Docker containers. And it also integrates features from task runners like Taskfile.

The purpose of the extension is to pretty much just let you see a list of all your services, which ones are running, and be able to start them, stop them, restart them, and attach to the logs.

## Zapper docs

Obviously, this integrates with the CLI. So the usage documentation for the CLI itself is important to read:
